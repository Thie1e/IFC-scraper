"11598" NA "Opportunity International, Inc, (Opportunity) is a tax-exempt, publicly supported Christian-based corporation whose purpose is to create employment and improve income for the poor by assisting in the establishment of small and micro businesses in developing countries. Opportunity’s programs are financed through direct solicitation of funds from individuals, corporations, foundations, churches and government grants. Over the past 30 years, OI has developed over 50 microfinance institutions in 25 countries in Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa. Opportunity now serves over 907,000 credit clients annually and expects to be serving 1 million by 2007, and 2 million by 2010. If clients served through deposit and insurance products are included, the number of clients currently served by OI already reaches beyond 1.5 million of the world’s poor. OI’s strategy is to effectively combine significant outreach to the lowest level of the microfinance sector with financial sustainability. Building on its successes, particularly in Eastern Europe, OI seeks to replicate this model widely in Africa. In June 2000, Opportunity incorporated Opportunity Transformation Investments, inc (OTI), which invests in and holds ownership positions in MFIs as they convert from NGOs to commercial MFIs or microfinance banks. OTI has majority equity positions in Opportunity International-Sinapi Aba Savings & Loans (Ghana), Opportunity International Bank Malawi (Malawi), Banco Oportunidade de Mozambique (Mozambique), OI-WEDCO (Kenya), Opportunity International Bank Rwanda (Rwanda), Opportunity Finance (South Africa), PSHM (Albania), Opportunity Bank Montenegro (Montenegro), and Opportunity Bank Serbia (Serbia). In addition to these majority holdings, OTI has minority holdings in Opportunity Microfinance Bank (Philippines), S.C. Opportunity Microcredit Romania s.R.L. (Romania), Development Finance Equity Partners GMBH (Switzerland), Zambuko Trust Limited (Zimbabwe), and Faulu (Uganda)."

NBG operates through a network of 575 domestic branches, effectively covering the country and is a market leader in the retail market, with a share of around 23% in household loans, and 24% market share in deposits.  NBG’s focus outside of Greece has been in Turkey and southeast Europe, where it operates in Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Albania and Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The acquisition of Finansbank in Turkey in 2006 has extended NBG’s reach further in the region into a much larger market.  Vojvodjanska Banka originates from Privredna Banka, a holding bank with 17 subsidiary banks, which was dissolved in 1989, in the context of the break-up of former Yogoslavia. In 2000, the government began a bank rehabilitation process, whereby it settled the state guaranteed liabilities of Serbian banks incurred prior to the breakup of Yugoslavia, in particular Paris and London Club debt. In 2002, the state approved a bank restructuring law under which the debt of Serbian banks to the state could be converted into equity in these banks and subsequently became the majority owner in some Serbian banks. In 2003, the government initiated the privatization process of all state owned banks, which resulted in NBG purchasing a 99.43% stake in Vojvodjanska Banka in December 2006. VB is currently undergoing a major transformation process aiming to upgrade the operational model and infrastructure, the information systems, the business service model and the branch network image and layout. Part of this process was the absorption of NBG Serbia (a wholly-owned subsidiary of NBG, present in the country since 2002).

Through this, Urbi has been ahead of the curve, having the first mover advantage by tapping new segments of the market, which has strengthened its credibility, brand as well as market positioning. During over 30 years of operations, Urbi has built more than 400,000 housing units.

The North West Niger Delta is characterized by mature oil and gas fields, with pipeline infrastructure in place, but with significant additional undeveloped gas reserves and a shortage of gas processing capacity.  Seven Energy’s strategy has been to grow its business primarily through (i) exploiting its existing asset base, (ii) establishing gas pipelines, processing, and transportation systems within its areas of operation through which it can transport production to the expanding Nigerian domestic gas and power market, (iii) negotiating supply agreements with upstream gas producers, (iv) reaching sales agreements with power and industrial producers, and (v) completing strategic acquisitions of attractive oil and gas assets. The Company’s expansion plan for the next few years is to strengthen its unique position as a key midstream player in the south-eastern part of Nigeria. This plan includes both upstream and midstream oil and gas activities. Seven Energy was founded by a group of Nigerian investors and international executives in 2004. It benefits from a strong management team experienced in upstream and midstream, as well as gas to power generation, under the leadership of CEO Phillip Ihenacho.
